  📜 Round 1: Foundational Questions

  Peter Drucker

  Management Philosophy

  "The most important thing in communication is hearing what isn't said."

  Questions for you:

  1. "What business are you really in?"
    - Are you in the education business, the health business, or the behavior change business?
    - How you answer this changes everything about your product.
  2. "Who is your customer, and what do they value?"
    - You said "general adults 25-55" — but can you describe ONE specific person who would pay $4.99/month for this?
    - What would they say to a friend about why they subscribed?
  3. "What results do you want to be remembered for?"
    - In 5 years, what would make this app a success in YOUR eyes?
    - Is it downloads? Lives changed? Revenue? Something else?

  Clayton Christensen

  Jobs-to-be-Done

  "People don't want a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole."

  Questions for you:

  4. "In what circumstance would someone 'hire' your app?"
    - Picture the moment someone downloads it. What just happened in their life?
    - Did they just get a health scare? Read an article? Have a conversation?
  5. "What are they 'firing' when they hire you?"
    - What solution are they abandoning? Google searches? Asking their doctor?
    - Why would your app do that job better?
  6. "What's the progress they're trying to make?"
    - Are they trying to learn something, or do something?
    - Is the goal knowledge, or is knowledge just a means to a different end?

  📜 Round 2: Risk & Resilience Questions

  Nassim Nicholas Taleb

  Antifragility & Risk

  "Wind extinguishes a candle but energizes fire. You want to be the fire."

  Questions for you:

  7. "What would kill this business?"
    - If Google adds "foods for heart health" to their search cards, what happens to you?
    - If a competitor copies your food-organ feature, what's left?
  8. "How do you become antifragile?"
    - What would make your app stronger when competitors enter?
    - Is there a way to benefit from chaos in the health app market?
  9. "What's your 'skin in the game'?"
    - Why are YOU the right person to build this?
    - What personal stake do you have beyond financial return?
  10. "What's the worst-case scenario you're ignoring?"
    - AI-generated health content is exploding. In 2 years, will your content have any value?
    - What if users don't want to pay for health information at all?

  📜 Round 3: Systems Thinking Questions

  Donella Meadows

  Systems Thinking & Leverage Points

  "A system is more than the sum of its parts. It may exhibit adaptive, dynamic, goal-seeking behavior."

  Questions for you:

  11. "What system are you part of?"
    - Map it: User → App → Behavior → Health Outcome
    - Where does your app actually intervene in this system?
  12. "What are the feedback loops?"
    - If a user learns about heart-healthy foods, what happens next?
    - Do they come back? Why or why not?
    - What brings them back repeatedly?
  13. "Where are the leverage points?"
    - Small changes that create big effects — where are they in your app?
    - Is it content? Notifications? Community? Personalization?
  14. "What behavior are you actually trying to change?"
    - Information doesn't change behavior. What does?
    - How will you know if your app actually improves someone's health?

  📜 Round 4: Competitive Reality Questions

  Michael Porter

  Competitive Strategy

  "The essence of strategy is choosing what NOT to do."

  Questions for you:

  15. "What are you choosing NOT to do?"
    - You listed many features. What will you explicitly refuse to build?
    - What requests will you say "no" to?
  16. "Why won't competitors copy you immediately?"
    - Your food-organ mapping — what stops WebMD from adding this tomorrow?
    - What's your moat? Data? Brand? Community? Technology?
  17. "Are you competing on cost or differentiation?"
    - $4.99/month positions you as premium. What justifies that premium?
    - Free alternatives are everywhere. What makes yours worth paying for?
  18. "What's your theory of value creation?"
    - Specifically, what value do you create that users can't get elsewhere?
    - Can you state it in one sentence?

  🎯 The Core Question

  All experts converge on one fundamental question:

  "If your app disappeared tomorrow, what would users actually miss?"

  Your answer to this question IS your product.

  💡 Insights to Consider

  Based on the questions above, consider these strategic implications:

  If You're in the Education Business

  - Content is king, but content is commoditized
  - You compete with free (Wikipedia, YouTube, ChatGPT)
  - Differentiation is very hard

  If You're in the Behavior Change Business

  - Content is just a tool
  - You need engagement loops, tracking, accountability
  - This is much harder but much more defensible

  If You're in the "Peace of Mind" Business

  - Users want to feel they're doing something for their health
  - Trust and credibility matter more than comprehensiveness
  - Curation > quantity
